What is an algebraic expresssion?
What is a term?
?
?
Similar terms
Dissimilar or unlike term
Coefficiente of a term

	Degree of a term
	Homogeneous terms
	Monomials
	Polynomials
	Trinomials
	Degree of an Algebraic expression
	And finally homogeneous polynomials




An algebraic expression is any representation of a number by algebraic notations
	3x + 4
	4ab - b
	5 + 4x + b2
	<> = inequality sign inecuation
	= equality sign - inequality
	
	First expression  second expression
	5 + 4x + b2      = 4ab - b
	--------------->this forms a equation
	expression only doesn't have equal sign

	A TERM, is an expression separated by a plus or a minus sign or an equality or inequality sign
	3x - 2a = 4c + 3 -terms 3x, -2a, 4c, 3  
	There is term groups by (), {}, []

	 3 * (x+2) + 4y = (2x + t)exp2
	 there are 3 terms->  3*(x+2)     4y    (2x + t)




similar or like terms are terms having the same
variables affected by the same exponents 
example we have
5x squared + 2 x squared
these are similar terms because they have the same variable X and the same
exponent 2 - a b and for a b are also similar terms because they both have the
same variables or letters and those variables have the same exponents next
4y + 2 y we have the same variable Y and therefore they are like terms before we
move on let's look at the exponent 1 every variable letter or
number that has no exponent written has an exponent of 1 so 4 5 X the X has an
exponent of 1 similarly for 2 a B the a has an exponent of 1 and the B also has
an exponent of 1 
dissimilar terms are terms which differ in variables or
exponents or both example 

The COEFFICIENT of a term is the constant, usually number, preceding a term
